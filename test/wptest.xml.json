				"slug": "page-image-alignment",
				"markdown": "Welcome to image alignment! The best way to demonstrate the ebb and flow of the various image positioning options is to nestle them snuggly among an ocean of words. Grab a paddle and let's get started.  \n  \nOn the topic of alignment, it should be noted that users can choose from the options of _None_, _Left_, _Right, _and _Center_. In addition, they also get the options of _Thumbnail_, _Medium_, _Large_ &amp; _Fullsize_.  \n  \n![Image Alignment 580x300](http://wptest.io/demo/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/image-alignment-580x300.jpg \"Image Alignment 580x300\")  \n  \nThe image above happens to be _**centered**_.  \n  \n**![Image Alignment 150x150](http://wptest.io/demo/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/image-alignment-150x150.jpg \"Image Alignment 150x150\")**The rest of this paragraph is filler for the sake of seeing the text wrap around the 150x150 image, which is _**left aligned**_.   \n  \nAs you can see the should be some space above, below, and to the right of the image. The text should not be creeping on the image. Creeping is just not right. Images need breathing room too. Let them speak like you words. Let them do their jobs without any hassle from the text. In about one more sentence here, we'll see that the text moves from the right of the image down below the image in seamless transition. Again, letting the do it's thang. Mission accomplished!  \n  \nAnd now for a _**massively large image**_. It also has _**no alignment**_.  \n  \n![Image Alignment 1200x400](http://wptest.io/demo/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/image-alignment-1200x4002.jpg \"Image Alignment 1200x400\")  \n  \nThe image above, though 1200px wide, should not overflow the content area. It should remain contained with no visible disruption to the flow of content.  \n  \n![Image Alignment 300x200](http://wptest.io/demo/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/image-alignment-300x200.jpg \"Image Alignment 300x200\")  \n  \nAnd now we're going to shift things to the _**right align**_. Again, there should be plenty of room above, below, and to the left of the image. Just look at him there... Hey guy! Way to rock that right side. I don't care what the left aligned image says, you look great. Don't let anyone else tell you differently.  \n  \nIn just a bit here, you should see the text start to wrap below the right aligned image and settle in nicely. There should still be plenty of room and everything should be sitting pretty. Yeah... Just like that. It never felt so good to be right.  \n  \nAnd just when you thought we were done, we're going to do them all over again with captions!  \n  \n[caption id=\"attachment_906\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"580\"]![Image Alignment 580x300](http://wptest.io/demo/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/image-alignment-580x300.jpg \"Image Alignment 580x300\") Look at 580x300 getting some [caption](http://en.support.wordpress.com/images/image-settings/ \"Image Settings\") love.[/caption]  \n  \nThe image above happens to be _**centered**_. The caption also has a link in it, just to see if it does anything funky.  \n  \n[caption id=\"attachment_904\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"150\"]![Image Alignment 150x150](http://wptest.io/demo/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/image-alignment-150x150.jpg \"Image Alignment 150x150\") Itty-bitty caption.[/caption]  \n  \nThe rest of this paragraph is filler for the sake of seeing the text wrap around the 150x150 image, which is _**left aligned**_.   \n  \nAs you can see the should be some space above, below, and to the right of the image.

It should remain contained with no visible disruption to the flow of content.  \n  \n[caption id=\"attachment_905\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\"]![Image Alignment 300x200](http://wptest.io/demo/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/image-alignment-300x200.jpg \"Image Alignment 300x200\") Feels good to be right all the time.[/caption]  \n  \nAnd now we're going to shift things to the _**right align**_.

With weighty problems to solve. With an urgent need or a mature discontent with the way things are today. Yes, I think all great posts begin before words are written.  \n  \nSo get up, reader.

Center is, but nature, a fence sitter. A flip flopper. It has a difficult time making up its mind. It wants to pick a side. Really, it does. It has the best intentions, but it tends to complicate matters more than help. The best you can do is try to win it over and hope for the best. I hear center align does take bribes.  \n  \n### Right Align  \n  \nThis is a paragraph. It is right aligned. It is a bit more conservative in it's views. It's prefers to not be told what to do or how to do it. Right align totally owns a slew of guns and loves to head to the range for some practice. Which is cool and all. I mean, it's a pretty good shot from at least four or five football fields away. Dead on. So boss.  \n  \n### Justify Align  \n  \nThis is a paragraph. It is justify aligned. It gets really mad when people associate it with Justin Timberlake. Typically, justified is pretty straight laced. It likes everything to be in it's place and not all cattywampus like the rest of the aligns. I am not saying that makes it better than the rest of the aligns, but it does tend to put off more of an elitist attitude.",

				"markdown": "Welcome to image alignment! The best way to demonstrate the ebb and flow of the various image positioning options is to nestle them snuggly among an ocean of words. Grab a paddle and let's get started.  \n  \nOn the topic of alignment, it should be noted that users can choose from the options of _None_, _Left_, _Right, _and _Center_. In addition, they also get the options of _Thumbnail_, _Medium_, _Large_ &amp; _Fullsize_.  \n  \n![Image Alignment 580x300](http://wptest.io/demo/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/image-alignment-580x300.jpg \"Image Alignment 580x300\")  \n  \nThe image above happens to be _**centered**_.  \n  \n**![Image Alignment 150x150](http://wptest.io/demo/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/image-alignment-150x150.jpg \"Image Alignment 150x150\")**The rest of this paragraph is filler for the sake of seeing the text wrap around the 150x150 image, which is _**left aligned**_.   \n  \nAs you can see the should be some space above, below, and to the right of the image. The text should not be creeping on the image. Creeping is just not right. Images need breathing room too. Let them speak like you words. Let them do their jobs without any hassle from the text. In about one more sentence here, we'll see that the text moves from the right of the image down below the image in seamless transition. Again, letting the do it's thang. Mission accomplished!  \n  \nAnd now for a _**massively large image**_. It also has _**no alignment**_.  \n  \n![Image Alignment 1200x400](http://wptest.io/demo/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/image-alignment-1200x4002.jpg \"Image Alignment 1200x400\")  \n  \nThe image above, though 1200px wide, should not overflow the content area. It should remain contained with no visible disruption to the flow of content.  \n  \n![Image Alignment 300x200](http://wptest.io/demo/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/image-alignment-300x200.jpg \"Image Alignment 300x200\")  \n  \nAnd now we're going to shift things to the _**right align**_. Again, there should be plenty of room above, below, and to the left of the image. Just look at him there... Hey guy! Way to rock that right side. I don't care what the left aligned image says, you look great. Don't let anyone else tell you differently.  \n  \nIn just a bit here, you should see the text start to wrap below the right aligned image and settle in nicely. There should still be plenty of room and everything should be sitting pretty. Yeah... Just like that. It never felt so good to be right.  \n  \nAnd just when you thought we were done, we're going to do them all over again with captions!  \n  \n[caption id=\"attachment_906\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"580\"]![Image Alignment 580x300](http://wptest.io/demo/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/image-alignment-580x300.jpg \"Image Alignment 580x300\") Look at 580x300 getting some [caption](http://en.support.wordpress.com/images/image-settings/ \"Image Settings\") love.[/caption]  \n  \nThe image above happens to be _**centered**_. The caption also has a link in it, just to see if it does anything funky.  \n  \n[caption id=\"attachment_904\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"150\"]![Image Alignment 150x150](http://wptest.io/demo/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/image-alignment-150x150.jpg \"Image Alignment 150x150\") Itty-bitty caption.[/caption]  \n  \nThe rest of this paragraph is filler for the sake of seeing the text wrap around the 150x150 image, which is _**left aligned**_.   \n  \nAs you can see the should be some space above, below, and to the right of the image.
